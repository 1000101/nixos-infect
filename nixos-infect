# nixos-infect is so named because there's a good chance the system will get
# sick if anything goes wrong, and possibly die, requiring reprovisioning.
# Use with caution.
#
# WARNING NB This script wipes out the targeted host's root filesystem when it
# runs to completion. Any errors halt execution. set -x is used to help debug,
# as often a failed run leaves the system in an inconsistent state, requiring a
# rebuild (in DigitalOcean panel: Droplet Settings -> "Destroy" -> "Rebuild
# from original").
#
# TO USE:
#  - Add any custom config you want (see notes below)
#  - Deploy a Debian 8.3 x64 droplet (enable ipv6; add your ssh key)
#  - cat customConfig.optional nixos-infect | ssh root@targethost bash
#
# This was last tested with the DigitalOcean Debian 8.3 x64 and Ubuntu 15.10
# x64 images. Different versions and archs (namely i386) should work as well,
# but then, there's not much point in selecting something different if you
# intend to wipe out the fs, as this script does. Some Ubuntu droplets have gpt
# partition tables but only a single ext4 root partition. It's way too much
# effort to try to get nixos to install grub using blocklists, so just avoid
# improperly configured images like those.
#
# You may need to make minor modifications to use in other templates, but
# basically all that will ever need tweaking are already inlined in this file:
#  /etc/nixos/{,hardware-}configuration.nix : rudimentary mostly static config
#  /etc/nixos/networking.nix, networking settings determined at runtime
#    tweak if no ipv6, different number of adapters, etc.
#
# Motivation for this script: nixos-assimilate should supplant this script
# entirely, if it's ever completed. nixos-in-place was quite broken when I
# tried it, and also took a pretty janky approach that was substantially more
# complex than this (although it supported more platforms): it didn't install
# to root (/nixos instead), left dregs of the old filesystem (almost always
# unnecessary since starting from a fresh deployment), and most importantly,
# simply didn't work for me! (old system was being because grub wasnt properly
# reinstalled)

set -ex

# If you have another NixOS host in the cloud, add it here to speed up the
# package downloads. Use "ssh -A" with your key loaded to run the script!
# (also ssh-keygen -R the host so that agent forwarding isn't disabled)
# This also reduces load on NixOS servers, so please make an effort to use it
# whenever possible. Better yet, just clone your VPS using snapshots.
